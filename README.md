## Overview

### The brief

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page portfolio website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The download includes mobile, tablet & desktop designs for a Homepage, Portfolio index page, Portfolio detail pages, and a Contact page. A design system is also included to provide colors, fonts, etc.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Also, seeing as this challenge is to build a portfolio site, please feel free to use it as your own portfolio website when you're finished!

Your users should be able to:

- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
    - The Name, Email Address or Message fields are empty should show "This field is required"
    - The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
